        <p> Hi my name is Michael Carpenter. I am 18 years old attending the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in computer science and looking to become a software engineer when I graduate. I am from Connecticut raised by 2 loving parents and a great older sister. I have a dog named Juno but we just call her pup-pup. In high school I had a succesful wrestling career, winning conference MVP and going 37-3 my senior year. My favorite show is breaking bad and my favorite movie is fight club or superbad. </p>
